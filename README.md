# Movie Recommendation App

Hosted in this GitHub repo are three short scripts for creating an LLM- and vector store-backed Movie Recommendation App. Use them and modify them as you wish.  

I suggest that you run the imdb_scraper and create_index scripts in a notebook, just in case any unforseen issues pop up with the review text.  

Conversely, running a Streamlit app from a notebook is a headache, so I advise that you run that from the command shell.  

Note: I wrote and ran these scripts on a Windows machine, so be aware of that if you're going to use them yourself.  

Also hosted in this repo is my version of the Customer Service App created for the DeepLearning.AI "Building Systems with the ChatGPT API"
course, mainly done because I wanted to see if I could get the necessary (reliable) output using only one function.

Have fun!
