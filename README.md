# Movie Recommendation App

Hosted in this GitHub repo are three short scripts for creating an LLM- and vector store-backed Movie Recommendation App. Use them and modify them as you wish.  

I suggest that you run the imdb_scraper and create_index scripts in a notebook, just in case any unforseen issues pop up with the review text.  

Conversely, running a Streamlit app from a notebook is a headache, so I advise that you run that from the command shell.  

Note: I wrote and ran these scripts on a Windows machine, so be aware of that if you're going to use them yourself.  

Have fun!
